Welcome to Nickbot!
===================

By Nick Butler
nick@codeindulgence.com

Ruby 1.9+ required
Tested using 1.9.3, 2.0.0 and 2.1.1

The only dependency is highline for the CLI
so you might need to:
  $ bundle install

Run tests with:
  $ rake test

Other than that, just run:
  $ ./bin/nickbot

One may also supply table dimensions when launching the CLI:
  $ ./bin/nickbot 8 5

Nickbot will start up and print out the following help:
  HELP   List available commands
  PLACE  Set robot's position. Syntax: X,Y,F
         F can be one of: NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST
  MOVE   Move forward in current direction
  LEFT   Rotate 90 degrees left
  RIGHT  Rotate 90 degrees right
  REPORT Announce current position and orientation
  EXIT   Shut down Nickbot

The first command that should be issued is PLACE, example:
  > PLACE 2,4,WEST

Once placed we can issue commands: MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT and REPORT.
Otherwise these commands will fail.

Movement and turn commands will simply tell us if they were successful.
To find out more about the current position, issue the report command:
  > REPORT

This will output a visual representation of the table and the robot's
current position.

Once one has had their way with nickbot, one may issue the exit command:
  > EXIT

Enjoy!
